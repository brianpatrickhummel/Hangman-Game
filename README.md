# Hangman-Game

### A simple version of the classic Hangman game where the user has 9 attempts at guessing the name of a musical group. 

My FIRST application! Built with Javascript and jQuery. Other than using the jQuery Blink library to animate the home screen message, no other libraries or frameworks were used.  Responsive layout via CSS media queries.  Deployed via GitPages.

## Features of the application include:

* Displays the number of guesses that remain.
* Displays the remaining number of un-guessed letters.
* Tracks which letters have already been guessed.
* Alerts when a duplicate letter guess has been made.
* Displays a photo of, and plays a song by, the musical group at the round's end.
* The song continues to play as background music throughout the next round of guessing.
* Tracks number of wins and losses.
